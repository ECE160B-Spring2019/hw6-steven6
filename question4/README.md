# Question 4

Using the point class that we used in clas, write a program that will compute 11 points of a quadratic curve in the form of ax^2+bx+c from -5 to 5. Prompt the user to input valuse for a, b, and c. Store these points in a struct array and print the points.

Provide at least 3 examples in the output below.

Compile Steps: gcc -o q4.out q4.c

Output:
Enter a value for a: 9
Enter a value for b: 9
Enter a value for c: 9
The following are 11 points on your curve:
(-5, 189)
(-4,117)
(-3, 63)
(-2, 27)
(-1, 9)
(0, 9)
(1,27)
(2,63)
(3,117)
(4, 189)
(5, 279)
Enter a value for a: 0
Enter a value for b: 0
Enter a value for c: 0
The following are 11 points on your curve:
(-5, 0)
(-4,0)
(-3, 0)
(-2, 0)
(-1, 0)
(0, 0)
(1,0)
(2,0)
(3,0)
(4, 0)
(5, 0)
Enter a value for a: 1
Enter a value for b: 1
Enter a value for c: 1
The following are 11 points on your curve:
(-5, 21)
(-4,13)
(-3, 7)
(-2, 3)
(-1, 1)
(0, 1)
(1,3)
(2,7)
(3,13)
(4, 21)
(5, 31)
